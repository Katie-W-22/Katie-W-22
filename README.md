Before the career change...

After achieving a masters degree in Mathematics from Durham University, I was a maths teacher for 18 years in the sixth-form sector, teaching A-levels in Maths and Further Maths.
During that time I also took on roles as NW2 Post-16 Maths-Hub Lead & Head of Department. I'm now a full-stack developer-in-training! 

I'm currently working on various projects and adding new features as I learn about them...Please see my pinned repos!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about:
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, RESTful APIs & CRUD functions, TDD, React, Next.js, Tailwind...and more!
