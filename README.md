### Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹ I'm a developer-in-training with the School of Code 

Before The School of Code...

For 18 years I was a maths teacher in the sixth-form sector, teaching A-levels in Maths and Further Maths.
During that time I also took on roles as NW2 Post-16 Maths-Hub Lead & Head of Department. I'm now a full-stack developer-in-training with The School of Code! Please see my portfolio-page for more details!

I'm currently working on various projects and adding new features as I learn about them...Please take a look below!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about:
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, RESTful APIs & CRUD functions, TDD...!
